# Black Anvil

Black Anvil is an experimental Rust-based installer that compiles and installs Rust
projects. It provides a simple interactive command-line interface to choose build
options and installation path, then invokes `cargo build` and copies the resulting
binary to the selected location.

This is an early prototype focusing on compiling Rust code before installation.
Future versions aim to provide a richer graphical interface and support for other
languages and packaging formats.
